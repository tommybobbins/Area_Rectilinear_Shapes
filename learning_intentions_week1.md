| I can create output pen strokes.                          |              |
| I can change variables as the program runs.               |              |
| I can modify use x and y co-ordinates.                    |              |
| I can rotate sprites to angles.                           |              |
| I can use the computer to count calculate the area.       |              |
| I can receive input from the user.                        |              |
| I can receive output lengths as they are drawn.           |              |
| I can compare user input to the correct answer.           |              |
